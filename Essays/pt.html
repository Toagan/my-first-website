    <h1>Peter Thiel's Principles for Success</h1>

    <h2>1. Be careful of competition</h2>
    <p>Avoid getting swept up in conventional competitions. Ask yourself if you truly want the prize on offer. Seek a more vertical reference point rather than horizontal comparisons.</p>

    <h2>2. Create new beginnings</h2>
    <p>Think about the future and invest in new beginnings. Challenge the existing order and be open to changing the direction of the world. Don't squander your ignorance; test conventions and traditions.</p>

    <h2>3. Test the wisdom of crowds</h2>
    <p>Question common beliefs and seek important truths that few people agree with. Be skeptical of advice, even from elders. Live each day as if you will live forever, making difficult decisions that matter in the long term.</p>

    <h2>4. Strive to be a polymath</h2>
    <p>Develop a broad understanding of various topics. Connect dots across different fields. Be aware that this approach might be seen as "dangerous" by those invested in the status quo.</p>

    <h2>5. Be courageous</h2>
    <p>Recognize that courage is in even shorter supply than genius. In entrepreneurship, boldness is often more important than brilliance. Pursue and build your ideas even if you don't have everything figured out.</p>

    <h2>6. Avoid mimicking others' success</h2>
    <p>Understand that every great moment in technology or business happens only once. The next big success will not be a copy of previous successes.</p>

    <h2>7. Seek hidden knowledge</h2>
    <p>Look for secrets in places where others aren't paying attention. The most valuable things are often found between conventions and mysteries.</p>

    <h2>8. Be an independent thinker</h2>
    <p>Don't simply follow trends or public opinion. Develop your own thoughts and ideas, even if they go against conventional wisdom.</p>

    <h2>9. Balance tradition and innovation</h2>
    <p>Recover what was best in tradition and render it fresh. Use tradition as a reference point for deeper exploration, not as a limitation.</p>

    <h2>10. Optimize for the long-term</h2>
    <p>Make decisions and investments that will compound over time. Focus on building things that will matter in the future.</p>

    <h2>11. Embrace contrarian views</h2>
    <p>Be willing to hold and express views that others might disagree with. This can lead to discovering new opportunities and insights.</p>

    <h2>12. Focus on creation over competition</h2>
    <p>Instead of competing in existing markets, create new ones. Look for opportunities to build something entirely new.</p>

    <h2>13. Cultivate optimism about the future</h2>
    <p>Maintain a positive outlook on the potential for creative shaping of the future, while thinking independently about how to achieve it.</p>
