My Personal Website

I've always been inspired by people who think deeply and do things with purpose. Paul Graham, Sam Altman, and Naval Ravikant are three individuals whose writing and ideas have significantly influenced the way I approach learning, creating, and sharing. Their openness in publishing their thoughts and work has inspired me to do the same—so this site is my space to publish not just my thoughts, but my projects, experiments, and learning journeys.

Why I’m Writing and Building
Writing helps clarify thoughts. Creating helps sharpen skills. Publishing both helps hold me accountable—and hopefully, can motivate others along the way.

Like Paul Graham, I believe that ideas improve when they're shared early and iterated on. Sam Altman's focus on constant growth and improvement through projects speaks to me, and Naval's emphasis on leverage and personal growth resonates with how I approach skill development.

This website is part of my process. It’s a place where I share not only essays but also the various projects I’m working on as I upskill in areas like technology, entrepreneurship, and beyond. The goal? To push myself, document my progress, and maybe even inspire others to start their own journey.

What You’ll Find Here
Essays and Ideas: My reflections on technology, startups, philosophy, and other topics that interest me. These are often inspired by what I'm learning or experimenting with at the time.

Projects: A showcase of the projects I’m working on, ranging from software builds to experiments in business, to personal upskilling efforts. These projects aren’t just for me—they're here to serve as proof of progress and a way to share lessons learned along the way.

Learning in Public: Some of what I publish will be polished; some of it won’t. The goal isn’t perfection—it’s growth. And I want to make that process visible. Upskilling in public not only keeps me accountable but also shows others what’s possible when you commit to learning something new.

Why Share?
I believe in the value of transparency and learning in public. By putting my work out there, I’m pushing myself to grow faster, but I’m also hoping to show others that the process of learning and building is messy but rewarding. Whether it’s a coding project, a business idea, or a new skill I’m trying to master, I want to demonstrate that consistent effort and sharing the journey are powerful forces for improvement.

Get Involved
If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you. Whether it's feedback, ideas, or just a conversation, feel free to reach out. I’m also always open to collaborating on interesting projects or learning together.

Thanks for visiting my site, and I hope something here inspires you to write, build, or start learning in public too.
