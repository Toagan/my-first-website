    <p>Working at Amazon Web Services, upskilling in all things tech.</p>
    <p>All views completely my own.</p>
    <p>I’ve always wanted to do something impactful but wasn’t sure where to start. I stumbled into charity sales and joined UNICEF. It clicked. I did well—$60K in revenue—but more importantly, I learned that selling something I truly believed in gave me energy. That was my first real insight: conviction drives performance. Still, I wanted to learn more. I went to university, studied business, and explored different ways to create impact. Tech stood out. It had scale, leverage, and the power to shape the future. I joined AWS, diving deep into enterprise sales and technical development, learning how innovation moves from idea to execution.Meanwhile, I watched AI evolve in the background—quietly, then suddenly. I realized that the biggest breakthroughs often struggle with commercialization. That’s where I see my role: amplifying the commercial process for the world’s most promising AI labs, helping transform cutting-edge research into real-world applications.</p>
